# StoneView Camera Dashboard

A creative interpretation of a security camera dashboard that displays multiple ESP32 camera streams in a 3x3 grid layout. This project is designed to capture and visualize real-time video feeds from ESP32 microcontrollers, presenting them in an aesthetically pleasing and functional interface.

## Project Overview

StoneView transforms your browser into a surveillance-style dashboard, displaying up to 9 simultaneous camera streams from ESP32 devices. Each stream is presented in a 16:9 aspect ratio within a clean, dark-themed interface.

### Features

- 3x3 grid layout optimized for viewing multiple streams
- Full viewport utilization with consistent spacing
- Unique camera ID overlays for each stream
- Dark theme for optimal viewing experience
- Responsive design that maintains aspect ratios

### Technical Stack

- React + TypeScript for the frontend
- Vite as the build tool
- ESP32-CAM as the video stream sources

## Development

This project is built with modern web technologies and is designed to be both performant and visually engaging while maintaining the aesthetic of surveillance systems.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- ESP32-CAM modules with appropriate firmware
- Modern web browser with WebSocket support

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Status

This is a creative project that explores the intersection of embedded systems and web technologies. While it resembles a security camera dashboard, its primary purpose is artistic and experimental rather than security-focused.

## Future Enhancements

- Stream status indicators
- Camera feed statistics
- Custom overlay options
- Motion detection visualization
- Stream recording capabilities
- Interactive grid layout
